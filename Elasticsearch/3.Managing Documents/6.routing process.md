# **Elasticsearch Routing Process**

## **📌 Overview**

Elasticsearch uses **Routing** to determine which **Shard** will store or retrieve a document. This process ensures efficient data distribution and retrieval in a **Cluster** consisting of multiple **Nodes** and **Shards**.

---

## **📌 Routing Process**

### **1️⃣ Request Reaches the Cluster**

- A **Client** sends a request (Read/Write) to the Elasticsearch **Cluster**.
- The request is received by one of the **Nodes**, which acts as the **Coordinating Node**.

### **2️⃣ Coordinating Node Determines the Target Shard**

- **Routing Formula is Applied:**
  ```
  shard_number = hash(_routing) % total_primary_shards
  ```
- This determines **which Primary Shard** should handle the request.
- Example:
  - `_routing = "123"`, `total_primary_shards = 6`
  - `shard_number = 3`

### **3️⃣ Coordinating Node Identifies the Node Containing the Shard**

- Cluster metadata is checked to locate **Shard-3**.
- **Primary Shard-3** is found on **Node-2**.

### **4️⃣ Adaptive Replica Selection (For Read Requests)**

- Instead of always querying the **Primary Shard**, Elasticsearch selects the **best shard copy**.
- The selection is based on:
  - Response time
  - Load balancing
  - Latency
- Example: If **Replica Shard-3** on **Node-3** is performing better, the request is sent there.

### **5️⃣ Request Processing**

- **Read Request:**
  - Data is fetched from the selected shard and sent back to the **Coordinating Node**.
- **Write Request (Index/Update/Delete):**
  - Data is written to the **Primary Shard**.
  - Once confirmed, it is replicated to the **Replica Shards**.

### **6️⃣ Coordinating Node Returns Response**

- The **final response** is collected and returned to the **Client**.

## **📌 Additional Notes**

- **Coordinating Node operates at the Cluster Level** and has access to **all Node metadata**.
- **Shards are located inside Nodes, not directly under the Cluster.**
- If a request is for a document that does **not exist**, Elasticsearch will return a **404 response**.
- Write operations **always go to the Primary Shard first** before syncing to Replicas.

## **📌 Summary**

✅ **Routing ensures efficient data distribution and retrieval in Elasticsearch.**  
✅ **Coordinating Node uses a routing formula to find the correct Shard.**  
✅ **Shard locations are determined using Cluster Metadata.**  
✅ **Adaptive Replica Selection optimizes read performance.**  
✅ **Writes always go to the Primary Shard first and then replicate.**
