# Managing Indices in Elasticsearch

## Overview

This document covers how to create and delete indices in an **Elasticsearch cluster** using Kibana HTTP verbs like `PUT` and `DELETE`.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating an Index

### Steps to Create an Index:

1. Use the `PUT` HTTP verb to create a new index.
2. Define the **shard** and **replica** settings inside the request body.
3. If settings are not explicitly provided, **default settings** will be used.

### Example Request:

```json
PUT /products
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 2,
    "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **number_of_shards**: Defines how many primary shards the index will have.
- **number_of_replicas**: Specifies the number of copies for each shard.

### Response:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "products"
}
```

- `acknowledged`: Confirms that the request was received successfully.
- `shards_acknowledged`: Ensures that all shards are assigned correctly.

üìå **Best Practice:** In production, it is recommended to use default settings unless you have specific requirements.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deleting an Index

### Steps to Delete an Index:

1. Use the `DELETE` HTTP verb.
2. Specify the index name to be deleted.
3. The forward slash (`/`) is optional in Kibana but preferred for clarity.

### Example Request:

```json
DELETE /pages
```

### Response:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
```

- `acknowledged`: Confirms the index was deleted successfully.

üìå **Note:** Once an index is deleted, **all data inside it is permanently lost**. Be cautious before running this command.

---

## Summary

- **Creating an index**: Use `PUT /index_name` with shard and replica settings.
- **Deleting an index**: Use `DELETE /index_name` (‚ö† irreversible operation).
- **Best Practice**: Use default settings in production unless needed.
