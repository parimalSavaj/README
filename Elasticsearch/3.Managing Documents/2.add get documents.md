# Indexing Documents in Elasticsearch

## 1. Indexing a Document (Adding Data)

To add a document, we send a **POST** request to `/{index_name}/_doc`. The document is defined as a **JSON object** in the request body.

### Example: Adding a Product Document

```json
POST /products/_doc
{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 1200,
  "in_stock": true
}
```

### Explanation:

- A document with fields (`name`, `price`, `in_stock`) is added to the `products` index.
- The response contains a `_shards` object, showing how many shards stored the document.

---

## 2. Understanding Shard Replication

- If an index has **2 primary shards and 2 replicas**, a document is stored across **3 shards** (1 primary + 2 replicas).
- This improves data redundancy and availability.

---

## 3. Assigning a Custom Document ID

By default, Elasticsearch **auto-generates an ID**. To **set a custom ID**, use **PUT** instead of POST.

### Example: Adding a Document with a Custom ID

```json
PUT /products/_doc/100
{
  "name": "Smartphone",
  "price": 800,
  "in_stock": false
}
```

### Explanation:

- This document will have a fixed `_id` of `100`.
- Using **PUT** ensures that the document is updated if it already exists.

## get document

- **get document based on name**

```json
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "Laptop"
    }
  }
}
```

- **get doc based on id**

```json
GET /products/_doc/q5YqR5UBACVeZC2JddYM
```
