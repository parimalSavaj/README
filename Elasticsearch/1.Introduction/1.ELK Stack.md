# Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)

Elastic Stack, formerly known as ELK Stack, is a powerful suite of open-source tools designed for searching, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of data in real-time. It includes multiple components, each serving a specific purpose in data collection, processing, storage, and visualization.

## 📌 Components of the Elastic Stack

### 1️⃣ Elasticsearch (Search & Analytics Engine)

- A distributed, scalable search engine.
- Stores and indexes data for fast retrieval.
- Uses RESTful APIs and supports full-text search.
- Built on Apache Lucene.

### 2️⃣ Logstash (Data Processing Pipeline)

- A powerful tool for collecting, transforming, and forwarding data.
- Supports various input sources (logs, metrics, databases, etc.).
- Can filter, enrich, and process data before sending it to Elasticsearch.
- Uses a pipeline-based architecture.

### 3️⃣ Kibana (Data Visualization & Dashboard)

- Web-based UI for exploring and visualizing Elasticsearch data.
- Supports interactive dashboards, maps, and graphs.
- Provides real-time monitoring and alerting.

### 4️⃣ X-Pack – Adds Advanced Features to Elasticsearch

X-Pack extends Elasticsearch with powerful features for security, monitoring, alerting, machine learning, reporting, and more.

- **`🔒 Security`**
- Authentication & Authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Encryption for data in transit & at rest

**`📊 Monitoring`**

- Performance tracking for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats
- Cluster health & node performance insights

- **`🚨 Alerting`**
- Real-time notifications via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and webhooks
- Condition-based alerts on logs, metrics, or custom data

- **`🧠 Machine Learning`**
- Anomaly detection for spotting unusual patterns in data
- Automated detection of outliers in time-series data

- **`📑 Reporting`**
- Export dashboards & visualizations as PDF, CSV, or PNG
- Scheduled and on-demand report generation

- **`🔗 Graph`**
- Discover relationships between documents
- Useful for fraud detection, recommendation systems, and network analysis

- **`🗄️ Elasticsearch SQL`**
- Query Elasticsearch indices using SQL syntax
- JDBC & ODBC support for BI tools like Tableau & Excel
- REST API and CLI for executing SQL queries
- Translates SQL queries into Elasticsearch Query DSL

### 5️⃣ Beats (Lightweight Data Shippers)

- Small, lightweight agents that collect and send data to Logstash or Elasticsearch.
- Different types of Beats:
  - **Filebeat** – Collects log files.
  - **Metricbeat** – Collects system and application metrics.
  - **Packetbeat** – Monitors network traffic.
  - **Winlogbeat** – Collects Windows event logs.
  - **Auditbeat** – Collects audit data.

## 🔹 Additional Technologies (Optional)

- **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** – Monitors application performance.
- **Elastic Security** – Provides SIEM (Security Information and Event Management).
