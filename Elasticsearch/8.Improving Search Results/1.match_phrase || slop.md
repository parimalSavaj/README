# Elasticsearch `match_phrase` Query and `slop` Parameter

## What is `match_phrase` Query?

- A **strict phrase search**, meaning words must appear **in the exact order** as given in the query.
- Example: Searching for `"spicy sauce"` will only return documents where **"spicy" is immediately followed by "sauce"**.

### Problem

- If a document contains text like `"spicy tomato sauce"`, the `match_phrase` query **will not return it** because an extra word (`"tomato"`) appears in between.
- We need some **flexibility** to allow a few words in between while still considering it a match.

### Solution - `slop` Parameter

- `slop` is an **integer** that defines how many words can appear between the search terms while still considering it a match.
- This is called **proximity search**, allowing controlled word reordering.

## Examples

### 1. `slop` = 0 (default, no flexibility)

```json
{
  "match_phrase": {
    "title": "spicy sauce"
  }
}
```

**Result:**

- Only exact matches like `"spicy sauce"` will be returned.
- `"spicy tomato sauce"` **will NOT match**.

### 2. `slop` = 1 (allowing 1 word gap)

```json
{
  "match_phrase": {
    "title": {
      "query": "spicy sauce",
      "slop": 1
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**

- `"spicy tomato sauce"` will match because **"sauce" can shift 1 position forward**.
- `"spicy chili tomato sauce"` **will NOT match**, as shifting requires 2 moves.

### 3. `slop` = 2 (allowing 2 words gap)

```json
{
  "match_phrase": {
    "title": {
      "query": "spicy sauce",
      "slop": 2
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**

- `"spicy chili tomato sauce"` will match, as **"sauce" can shift 2 positions**.
- `"sauce spicy"` can also match since swapping twice can reorder words correctly.

## Key Takeaways

✅ `match_phrase` query **strictly enforces word order**.
✅ `slop` **adds flexibility** by allowing extra words in between.
✅ Higher `slop` values **allow more swaps and gaps**.
✅ Adjust `slop` **based on your data and use case**.
