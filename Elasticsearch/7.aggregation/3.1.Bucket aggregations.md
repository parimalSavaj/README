### **Bucket Aggregations in Elasticsearch** ðŸš€

Bucket aggregations **group documents into buckets** based on a field value, range, or custom logic. Unlike **metric aggregations** (which return numerical summaries), **bucket aggregations create categories of documents** and allow further sub-aggregations.

### **List of Bucket Aggregations & What They Do**

| **Aggregation**         | **What It Does**                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`terms`**             | Groups documents by unique values of a field (like SQL `GROUP BY`).                               |
| **`range`**             | Groups documents into manually defined numeric ranges.                                            |
| **`date_range`**        | Groups documents into manually defined date ranges.                                               |
| **`histogram`**         | Groups numeric values into equal-sized intervals (bins).                                          |
| **`date_histogram`**    | Groups date values into equal time intervals (daily, weekly, etc.).                               |
| **`filters`**           | Groups documents into multiple categories using multiple filter queries.                          |
| **`missing`**           | Creates a bucket for documents where a specified field is missing.                                |
| **`nested`**            | Aggregates inside a `nested` field (useful for `nested` data types).                              |
| **`reverse_nested`**    | Moves back from a `nested` context to the parent document.                                        |
| **`geo_distance`**      | Groups documents into distance-based buckets from a given geo point.                              |
| **`geohash_grid`**      | Groups geographic locations into geohash grid cells.                                              |
| **`adjacency_matrix`**  | Creates buckets based on multiple boolean filters and their relationships.                        |
| **`significant_terms`** | Finds terms that are significantly more frequent in a subset of data compared to the whole index. |

### **Example: `terms` Aggregation on Your Index**

#### **Find Total Sales per Sales Channel**

```json
GET index_name/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "sales_by_channel": {
      "terms": { "field": "sales_channel" },
      "aggs": {
        "total_sales": {
          "sum": { "field": "total_amount" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Expected Response**

```json
{
  "aggregations": {
    "sales_by_channel": {
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "online",
          "doc_count": 500,
          "total_sales": { "value": 50000.75 }
        },
        {
          "key": "retail",
          "doc_count": 300,
          "total_sales": { "value": 35000.25 }
        },
        {
          "key": "wholesale",
          "doc_count": 200,
          "total_sales": { "value": 15000.0 }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Why Use Bucket Aggregations?**

- **Summarizes categorical data** (e.g., grouping sales by channel).
- **Supports nested aggregations** (you can calculate metrics within each bucket).
- **Efficient for analytics dashboards** (e.g., sales breakdown by month).
