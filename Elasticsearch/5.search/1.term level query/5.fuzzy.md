### **📌 When to Use `fuzzy` Query?**

✅ **When users may make spelling mistakes** (e.g., `"iphne"` instead of `"iPhone"`).  
✅ **For better search user experience**, allowing approximate matches.  
✅ **For autocomplete & suggestion features**.

❌ **Avoid using `fuzzy` queries on structured fields** (`numeric`, `boolean`, `date`), as they work best with `text` fields.
