# AWS SAM Template (`template.yml`)

## 📌 What is `template.yml`?

`template.yml` is the **main configuration file** in an AWS Serverless Application Model (**AWS SAM**) project.  
It defines all the AWS resources your serverless application needs, such as:

- AWS Lambda functions
- API Gateway
- S3 Buckets
- DynamoDB tables
- IAM Roles
- Step Functions (State Machines)

Instead of creating these resources manually in the AWS console, we **define them in `template.yml`**, and AWS `CloudFormation` **automatically provisions them** when we deploy.

## 🔧 How Does It Work?

1️⃣ **Write your AWS resource definitions** in `template.yml`.  
2️⃣ **Run `sam deploy`** to send the template to AWS.  
3️⃣ **CloudFormation reads the template** and creates the resources.  
4️⃣ **Your AWS infrastructure is now live!** 🚀

## 🎯 What Does `template.yml` Do?

✅ **Defines AWS resources** (Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).  
✅ **Automates deployment** – No manual setup needed.  
✅ **Ensures consistency** – Every deployment is the same.  
✅ **Supports version control** – Store it in Git to track changes.  
✅ **Works across environments** – Easily deploy to Dev, Test, and Prod.
