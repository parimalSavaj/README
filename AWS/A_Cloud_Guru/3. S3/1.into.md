## 📦 Working with S3 Buckets

> 🔹 1️⃣ Universal Namespace

- All AWS accounts **share the S3 namespace**.
- **Bucket names must be globally unique** across all AWS accounts.

> 🔹 2️⃣ Example S3 URLs

S3 provides **RESTful URLs** to access objects stored in a bucket.

**URL Format:**

example

- **https://fayecloudguru.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Ralphie.jpg**

## 📦 Amazon S3 Object Components

An **S3 object** consists of four main components:

> 🔹 1️⃣ Key (Object Name) 🏷️

- The **unique identifier** for an object within a bucket.
- Works like a **file path** in a folder system.
- **Example:** `"videos/movie.mp4"`

> 🔹 2️⃣ Value (Data) 📂

- The actual **file content** stored in S3.
- Can be **any type** of file (image, video, document, etc.).

> 🔹 3️⃣ Version ID 🔄 _(If Versioning is Enabled)_

- A **unique ID** assigned to each object version.
- Allows storing **different qualities** of the same file under the same key.

**How Version ID Helps with Different Qualities?**

If you upload the same file **"movie.mp4"** in different qualities, each version gets a unique **Version ID** while keeping the same **key (file name)**:

| Version ID | Quality | Object URL                                                            |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v1abc`    | 480p    | `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/movie.mp4?versionId=v1abc` |
| `v2xyz`    | 720p    | `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/movie.mp4?versionId=v2xyz` |
| `v3mno`    | 1080p   | `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/movie.mp4?versionId=v3mno` |
| `v4pqr`    | 4K      | `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/movie.mp4?versionId=v4pqr` |

- **Without Version ID** → Always returns the latest version.
- **With Version ID** → Fetches a specific quality/version of the object.

> 🔹 4️⃣ Metadata 📝

- **Extra information** about the object (e.g., file type, size, permissions).
- Two types:
  - **System metadata** (managed by AWS, e.g., Last Modified Date).
  - **User-defined metadata** (custom tags added by users).
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "Content-Type": "image/png",
    "Last-Modified": "2025-02-22T12:00:00Z",
    "Custom-Tag": "profile-picture"
  }
  ```
