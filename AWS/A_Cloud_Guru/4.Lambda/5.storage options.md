# AWS Lambda Storage Options

## **Native within Lambda**

### **/tmp Ephemeral Storage**

- **Use Case**: Temporary data storage.
- **Size Limit**: Ranges from 512 MB to 10 GB.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Supports dynamic read/write operations.
- **Shared**: Storage is shared within the execution environment but not across multiple Lambda invocations.

### **Lambda Layer**

- **Use Case**: Used to store libraries and SDKs.
- **Size Limit**: 50 MB zipped and 250 MB unzipped.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Requires a new layer for updates (not dynamic).
- **Shared**: Storage is shared across execution environments, meaning it can be used across multiple Lambda invocations.

## **External Storage Options**

### **S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)**

- **Use Case**: Storing persistent data.
- **Size Limit**: Elastic (scales as needed).
- **Dynamic Updates**: Supports store and retrieve operations (not direct read/write like a filesystem).
- **Shared**: Storage is shared across execution environments, meaning multiple Lambda functions can access it.

### **EFS (Amazon Elastic File System)**

- **Use Case**: Storing persistent data.
- **Size Limit**: Elastic (scales as needed).
- **Dynamic Updates**: Supports dynamic read/write operations, similar to a traditional file system.
- **Shared**: Storage is shared across execution environments, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time data access across multiple Lambda functions.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Use `/tmp`** for temporary storage within the Lambda execution environment.
- **Use Lambda Layers** to share libraries and dependencies across multiple Lambda functions.
- **Use S3** for storing large-scale persistent data, but data access requires explicit retrieval (not real-time read/write).
- **Use EFS** for real-time shared storage across multiple Lambda executions, making it ideal for applications needing fast, shared file access.
