# ⚡ AWS Lambda

## 📡 Serverless Architecture

In a **serverless** setup, applications are broken into **small, independent functions** (microservices) that run in the cloud. Each function is triggered **only when needed**, eliminating the need for server management.

### 📌 Example: Food Delivery App using AWS Lambda

In a food delivery app, different functions handle specific tasks:

- ✅ **Order Function** → Handles new orders
- ✅ **Payment Function** → Processes payments
- ✅ **Notification Function** → Sends SMS/Emails

### 🚀 How It Works?

1️⃣ If an order is placed, only the **Order Function** runs.  
2️⃣ If payment is needed, only the **Payment Function** runs.  
3️⃣ Each function **scales automatically** without affecting others.

## 🔹 Key Features

- **🎯 Event-driven**: Can be triggered by various AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, SNS, etc.).
- **📈 Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales based on demand.
- **💰 Pay-as-you-go**: Charged only for execution time and resources used.
- **🛠️ Supports multiple languages**: Write functions in **Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET**, and more.
- **🔗 Seamless AWS integration**: Works well with **S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch**, and other AWS services.

## 🔹 How It Works

1. **📤 Upload your function** (code) to **AWS Lambda**.
2. **⚡ Configure an event source** (e.g., HTTP request via API Gateway, object upload in S3, etc.).
3. **🚀 AWS Lambda automatically executes** the function when the event occurs.
4. **🖥️ Runs in a fully managed environment** with allocated resources.
5. **🔍 AWS handles scaling, maintenance, and monitoring** automatically.

## 🔹 Use Cases

- **🌐 Backend logic** for web or mobile applications.
- **📊 Processing real-time data streams** (e.g., logs, analytics).
- **📂 Automating file processing** in S3.
- **🔌 Building serverless APIs** using API Gateway + Lambda.
- **⏰ Running scheduled tasks** without maintaining a server.
