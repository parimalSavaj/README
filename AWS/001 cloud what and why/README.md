> what is cloud and why it's used?

Last see example, we create one web site and this web-site access the world. for this you do same step...

- Every one can access for you buy public IP address or domain name. so, other can access using your public IP or domain name. ex:- "http://<your_ip>:port_number" or "http://domain_name".

- Every user can access your site any time. so, your laptop is ON 24*7.

- Handle users request and storing data we need RAM, CPU, etc...

- if user load increase so we need incred hardware. and if you create web-site for 1000 user to handle hardware but only comes 10 user so your hardware is waste.

*But this cloud servers provider provide this type of server.*

IT services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) delivered over the internet. These services are provided by cloud providers (like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud), and anyone with an internet connection can access these services based on their requirements.
